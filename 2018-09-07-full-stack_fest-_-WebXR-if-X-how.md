These are my notes from Full-stack fest 2018 Barcelona conference.

> This talk will look at how WebXR can be used to design and test user interactions and interfaces. WebXR has made the creation of XR more accessible to developers and user as it JavaScript can be used to create XR projects which can be viewed across multiple platforms. This accessibility means that designers and artists have a way to easily try out new interactions.
> The talk starts with an overview of current philosophies and examples of UX and UI in XR and question current assumptions. It will then show ways to create paper storyboard for XR. This will be followed by an introduction to A-Frame, a Web XR JavaScript library, and how it can be used to quickly create and test different user interface solutions. It will also look at the different ways that users can interact with XR from classic game controllers, to using Arduino’s, sensors and gestures. It will wrap up with a look at how WebXR can be used with non coders to create new XR projects.

Samsung Internet ie a Chromium Based Evergreen Browser. 

The physical and the virtual world are merging.

Early devices were quite ugly :D now there's hololens, leapmotion, which can make your hands an interface.

XR on the web. (XR?)
The web on XR.

New browsers: desktop, mobile, XR browser. 

You're maybe navigating a website which has a VR version, you just put a headset on and you're in.

3 examples: museum experience, solar system education, pandas :D

The main way is using the WebXR spec from W3C, which can do AR and VR with a headset and sensors (a phone, like)

(Too much code and too beautiful live demo, it's better to see the video and the slides)
