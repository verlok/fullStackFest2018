These are my notes from Full-stack fest 2018 Barcelona conference.

> Learn how to use HTML5 and Unity together to create an isomorphic application for games or or other visualization-intensive applications that can be run in the browser, desktop and even mobile devices without sacrificing the most powerful aspects of native environments.
> The Unity Video game engine provides developers and designers with an amazing set of tools for creating beautiful 2D and 3D applications, but developing user interfaces is a chore. HTML component libraries can give us powerful, dynamic UIs that can interact with a Unity application.

"Why can't I use aframe? I have lots of beautiful functionalities and integrates with Angular, React and Vue."

First one to use Unity were the Sims company. Today Unity is used in Architecture projects, NASA, medical. 

Using with Chrommium Embedded Framework, aka CEF. It's an Open-source library to embed a web browser engine in any app. Like Electron does. A lot of desktop apps are made with it, like Spotify, Github, etc.

Why do I need Unity then? 

- it exports to everything --> PS4, iPhones, (see slides for all)
- VR/AR and other hardware support
- the asset store

The asset store has 58k+ assets already there.

The editor is amazing, I can pick assets and put it fisually there. It supports the shader, and shader graph to make really complex animations. Geometry shader, compute shader, amazing stuff. And Cinemachine and Timeline to create film/animation. Companies are starting to make movies inside of it.

## Unity + HTML5 

Ad the end of the talk I want to do something like a 3d graph with X, Z and Y coordinates.

- set up unityand browsser
- send messages from the browser
- send messages from unity

Desktop apps embed a browser, so inside of the game you can have an object which is a browser. Using the editor you can just put a URL in the editor and get the browser window in the game.

In the demo shows how to create objects in unity editor.
