These are my notes from Full-stack fest 2018 Barcelona conference.

> The launch of tensorflow.js library in March 2018 has put the power of machine learning into the hands of the javascript developer, and with its specific capability to run machine learning programs entirely on the client-side, into the hands of the front-end dev.
> This talk documents Susanna's three month journey into executing machine learning in her existing React projects, specifically on how to integrate the tensorflow library within the existing React workflow ( e.g how to set up, how to test it, how to webpack it? all that is such a mystery), how to set up training models in the browser, experimentation on what you could do with it on the front-end side (Dom-manipulation, etc), and specfically, how to execute the training models in balance with web performance.
