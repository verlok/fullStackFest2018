These are my notes from Full-stack fest 2018 Barcelona conference.

> Unfortunately, we still treat accessibility in the same way we deal with front-end development for older browsers, something to be done at the end. What if I tell you that we can use the latest Web APIs and still offer an inclusive and accessible experience.
> In this talk, you'll learn how to combine Web APIs such as Speech Recognition and Geolocation, with performant Javascript techniques to create empathic user interfaces.

Great overview about what accessibility is and why should we developers assure it.

Also good in-depth talk about the speech recognition API.

(sorry I watched it online and I couldn't take better notes, if you have them please open a PR)
